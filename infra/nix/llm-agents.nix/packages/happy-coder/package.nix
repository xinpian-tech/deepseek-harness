  # Upstream's postinstall (scripts/unpack-tools.cjs) extracts a 100 MB
  # multi-platform tarball collection (ripgrep / difftastic / a ripgrep
  # NAPI addon) into tools/unpacked/. The Mach-O / glibc binaries don't
  # work in the Nix sandbox anyway, so:
  #   - skip the script (pnpmConfigHook already passes --ignore-scripts)
  #   - drop the archives to slim down the closure
  #   - symlink nixpkgs' ripgrep + difftastic so the hardcoded
  #     `tools/unpacked/{rg,difft}` lookups succeed
  #   - leave ripgrep.node missing — ripgrep_launcher.cjs falls back to
  #     the rg binary (and to PATH) when require() on the addon fails.
