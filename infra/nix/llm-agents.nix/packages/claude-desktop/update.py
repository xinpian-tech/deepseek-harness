"""Update claude-desktop from Anthropic's APT index and darwin release feed.

Anthropic publish Claude Desktop as prebuilt Debian packages through an APT
repository; there is no source tree and no GitHub releases. This script reads
the per-architecture Packages index, picks the highest version for each arch,
and records the download URLs and SRI hashes in hashes.json. The two arches may
sit at different versions when one lags behind, so each arch is handled on its
own and the top-level version follows x86_64-linux.

macOS builds are distributed through a Squirrel.Mac feed (RELEASES.json) as a
single universal zip covering both darwin arches. That channel is versioned
independently of the APT one, so per-platform versions are recorded in a
"versions" map (package.nix falls back to the top-level "version" for any
platform missing from it).
